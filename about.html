        Oh, hi.
    <br><br>
        Welcome to the void
    <br><br>
        It was created when The Coder gave up on making a legitimate about me section
    <br><br>
        Once you're here, you can't go back, as you can see, there's no navigation bar in sight.
    <br><br>
        It's not too lonely, once you get used to it.
    <br><br>
        Well, that's not true.
    <br><br>
    
        I miss the sunlight.
    <br>
        And color.
    <br>
        And people.
    <br><br><br><br>
        You're actually he first person to come here in a while.
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>     
        Do you mind staying here for a little bit.
    <br><br>
        Thank you.
    <br><br>
        It's nice to have someone around every once and a while.
