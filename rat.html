    <p class="title">Rats</p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-content">As explained on the homepage, I will be giving reasons as to why rats are really cool and not gross and freaky at all. Also, I hope you weren't expecting a well structured essay on why rats are cool, no. This will be pure incoherent rambling. It's a rat website, what were you expecting.</p>

    <p class="list-header">3. Rats are really smart</p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-content">Rats are so smart you guys it's crazy. They've been shown to excel in understanding basic concepts and basic problem solving, showing to be more intelligent than cats, dogs and horses. Hence why so many experiments are done using "Lab Rats". They're known to be much more cooperative and capable whe presented with a problem. Who knew that an animal with such a tiny head could be so much smarter than most other animals 50 times it's size.</p>

    <p class="list-header">2. Rats are very friendly</p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-content">Rats are so friendly you guys it's crazy. For animals that have been seen as gross disease carriers by most for literal centuries, they are surprisingly down to chill with humans. Having a rat as a pet is a pretty big responsibility, they require a lot of attention and love to play around with their owners. They love to learn tricks, cuddle, maybe possibly chew on furniture, all the cool pet things. I know it sounds like I'm sponsored by rats, but no, if you check out any videos from people who have rats, they seem to have almost nothing negative to say about them. </p>

    <p class="list-header">1. Rats are good at sniffing out mines</p>
    <p class="article-content">Rats are so good at clearing out minefields you guys it's crazy. Specifically giant pouched rats. They're honestly the perfect animal to utilise to remedy the ever present threat of minefields in the world (primarily in Southeast Asia). Rats possess the intelligence to understand the basic task being given to them. Sniff out the mines, inform the humans of them, and then the humans mark down the location of the mine to be dealt with properly later. You may be wondering: "Dogs can do that! Why don't they just use dogs!?", well it's pretty simple actually. Rats are too small to accidentally set off the mines. They definitely can't cover as much ground as dogs, but the risk of one accidentally going off drops to zero. Though their speed is not to be underestimated. Giant pouched rats are fast, and are able to cover a lot of ground in a day. They can also smell tuberculosis but that's besides the point. Rats are just really really cool.</p>
